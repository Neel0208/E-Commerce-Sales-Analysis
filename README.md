# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis
Python

This project performs a detailed analysis of e-commerce sales data, focusing on key metrics such as sales trends, order priority, shipping modes, and profit margins. Using Python and data visualization libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy, the project generates actionable insights for improving sales strategies, marketing efforts, and decision-making.

# [Project Description]

This analysis explores sales data from an e-commerce platform to identify key patterns, trends, and opportunities. The analysis focuses on:

Data cleaning to ensure the dataset is accurate and ready for analysis

Sales performance analysis by various factors like order priority, shipping mode, product category, and customer segment.

Profitability analysis based on different product categories, sub-categories, and regions.

Top-performing regions and products based on sales and profit margins.

# [Technologies Used]

Python: Programming language for data processing and analysis. 

Pandas: Library for data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.

NumPy: Library for numerical operations.

Jupyter Notebooks: Used for interactive analysis and visualizations.



# Data Analysis

[Data Cleaning] :

Handling Missing Values: Identifying and imputing missing values using appropriate techniques.

Data Type Conversion: Ensuring that each column has the correct data type (e.g., date columns converted to datetime).

Outlier Detection: Identifying and handling outliers that could skew the analysis.

Data Formatting: Standardizing column names and values for consistency.




# [Key Metrics Analyzed]:

Order Priority: Analyzing the distribution of orders by priority.

Sales Based on Ship Mode: Evaluating the total sales for each shipping mode (e.g., Standard, Express, etc.).

Sales by Product Category: Analyzing sales performance across different product categories.

Customer Segments: Breaking down sales based on different customer segments (e.g., Consumer, Corporate).

Product Sub-Category Performance: Analyzing the performance of sub-categories within the product categories.

Profit by Product Category: Examining profit margins for different product categories.

Profit by Region: Analyzing profits across various regions.

Top 5 States by Sales: Identifying the top 5 states with the highest sales.

Product-Based Margin: Analyzing margins for individual products.





# [Visualizations]

Several visualizations were created to illustrate the findings:

Count of Orders by Priority: A bar chart displaying the number of orders for each order priority.

Sales Based on Ship Modes: A pie chart showing the distribution of sales across different shipping modes.

Sales by Product Category: A bar chart that visualizes the sales for each product category

Customer Segments: A pie chart displaying the sales contribution of different customer segments

Product Sub-Category Performance: A bar chart showing the sales and profits for each product sub-category

Profit by Product Category: A bar chart visualizing profits across different product categories.

Profit by Region: A bar chart displaying profit distribution across various regions.

Top 5 States by Sales: A bar chart showing the top 5 states with the highest sales.

Product-Based Margin: A bar chart displaying the margin for each product.



# [Conclusion]

This analysis provides valuable insights into the sales performance of the e-commerce platform, including:

Which order priorities contribute the most to sales.

The shipping modes that lead to the highest sales.

The best-performing product categories and sub-categories.

The regions and customer segments driving profits.
